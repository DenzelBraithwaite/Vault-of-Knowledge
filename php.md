## **Fundamentals**

White space does not matter in php.

<br>

### **Starting a PHP file**

```php
<?php
echo "Hello Planet";
?>

/* These are also acceptable, but less reliable.
<? ?>
<?= ?>
<% %>
*/
```

<mark>finish this...</mark>

<br>
<br>

### **Embedding PHP in HTML**

```php
$title = "Hello World of PHP";

<h1><?php echo $title; ?></h1>
```

<mark>finish this...</mark>

<br>
<br>

### **Working with Variables**

Variables are for storing data. In PHP, we declare a variable by prepending the variable name with a dollar sign, e.g. `$variableName`. The convention is to use **lowerCamelCase**, but there are many different ways to declare a variable; however, you can't start a variable name with a number and you should avoid putting dashes in the name so it doesn't get mistaken for subtraction. Variables are also case-sensitive.

```php
$string = "I am a variable"; // String
$number = 1234567890; // Number / Integer
$alsoNumber = 3.141592654; // Floating point number


```

### **Working with Strings**

<br>

#### **Concatenation**

You can concatenate data with the **dot**`.` operator.

```php
$name = "Kaz";
$age = 26;

// Outputs Kaz is 26
echo $name . " is " . $age
```
