## Overview

This guide is focused on all notes related to **C#** and **.net**. Whenever relevant, it will focus on using **Visual Studio** on a windows PC (as opposed to VS Code with extentions on a mac since Visual Studio Mac was discontinued late 2024). My references will be left at the bottom of the document. The vast majority of my notes for C# will come from the Microsoft official documentation and a Udemy course I'm following offered by Denis Panjuta.
