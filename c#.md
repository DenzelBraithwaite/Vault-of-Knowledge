## Overview

This guide is focused on all notes related to **C#** and **.net**. Whenever relevant, it will focus on using **Visual Studio** on a windows PC (as opposed to VS Code with extentions on a mac since Visual Studio Mac was discontinued late 2024). My references will be left at the bottom of the document. The vast majority of my notes for C# will come from the Microsoft official documentation and a Udemy course I'm following offered by Denis Panjuta.

## **Fundamentals**

C# is the primary language of the .NET platform, a free, open-source, cross-platform development environment used to build applications for devices ranging from IoT to cloud services. It is a general-purpose, object-oriented language influenced by C, C++, and Java, designed for developer productivity and high performance while supporting functional techniques and low-level efficiency without unsafe code. With millions of users and strong ecosystem support across all .NET workloads, C# powers most of the .NET runtime and libraries, making it familiar, versatile, and widely adopted for modern app development.
