## Overview

Databases are for storing information, but in almost all cases we need to manipulate that data. We call these **CRUD** operations. The goal is to **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** data. This guide will serve as a reminder for common SQL queries, as well as a knowledge base for SQL fundamentals.

## **Fundamentals**

SQL is a declarative language that was designed with non-technical people in mind. A declarative language syntax focuses on specifying the result of what you want as opposed to an imperative language which focuses on giving the computer an explicit sequence of commands to perform. It reads like a natural language ex: `SELECT first_name FROM employees` and always begins with a verb that describes the action, such as `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.

### **Comments**

Comments, just like in any programming language, is code that is ignored by the computer. In SQL, you can create a comment by using 2 dashes(or hyphens) `--` which tells the database to ignore this. Comments are very useful for documentation.

```sql
-- This is a comment. This will be ignored by the database, like a ninja ü•∑üèΩ.
```

<br>

You can also create a multi-line comment using 2 asterixs wrapped in forward slahes (`/**/`).

```sql
/*
All of this;
will be
-- ignored
*/
```

<br>
<br>

### **Commands**

We use commands to tell SQL what we want to do, at the end of each command we put a semicolon`;` to indicate the end of the command. When writing commands, it's common to add a new line (_since it won't affect the command_) after each verb for readability.

```sql
-- First command
SELECT *
FROM TABLE_NAME_HERE
WHERE first_name = 'Denzel';

-- Second command
DELETE * FROM TABLE_NAME_HERE WHERE last_name = 'Braithwaite';
```

Commands are composed of [literals](#literals), [keywords](#keywords), [identifiers](#identifiers) or [expressions](#expressions). We call all of these `tokens` and tokens can be separated by spaces, tabs or new lines.

<br>
<br>

### **Literals**

Literals (also called **constants**), are explicit values that are either string(`'wrapped in quotes'`), numeric or binary.

```sql
'John' -- string
'26' -- string
26 -- numeric
-26.9 -- numeric
x'01' -- Binary, using x'0000' notation
```

<br>
<br>

### **Keywords**

Keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as names for tables, columns, indexes or any other database object. Some common examples you'll see are the **verbs** that are at the beginning of commands, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT` and `DROP`. To make SQL commands more readable, it's common to type keywords uppercased, but this is not necessary.

<br>
<br>

### **Identifier**

Identifiers refer to specific objects in the database such as tables and columns.

```sql
SELECT first_name -- SELECT is the keyword, first_name is the identifier (column)
FROM users; -- FROM is the keyword, users is the identifier (table)
```
