## Overview

Databases are for storing information, but in almost all cases we need to manipulate that data. We call these **CRUD** operations. The goal is to **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** data. This guide will serve as a reminder for common SQL queries, as well as a knowledge base for SQL fundamentals.

## **Fundamentals**

SQL is a declarative language that was designed with non-technical people in mind. A declarative language syntax focuses on specifying the result of what you want as opposed to an imperative language which focuses on giving the computer an explicit sequence of commands to perform. It reads like a natural language ex: `SELECT first_name FROM employees` and always begins with a verb that describes the action, such as `UPDATE` or `DELETE`.
