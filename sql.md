## Overview

Databases are for storing information, but in almost all cases we need to manipulate that data. We call these **CRUD** operations. The goal is to **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** data. This guide will serve as a reminder for common SQL queries, as well as a knowledge base for SQL fundamentals.

The material I've found is a mixture of:

-   Le Wagon(Kitt) Study Docs

-   Stackoverflow

-   [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/exercise.asp)(They have some great exercises)

-   Other various websites

-   **R** Use `SELECT` to read from a database.

-   **U**
