# **Vault-of-Knowledge**

<br>

During my journey to becoming a web developer(currently a junior, also looking into game development), I've always struggled to make notes for myself. All of my notes were scattered both on paper and digitally and it was affecting my learning. I decided to create a repo to hold all of my notes and to use Markdown to make it more readable. These notes are still growing over time and I'm the only one maintaining them, so please double check any information you find here if it seems outdated. Because code full time, I don't have as much time to add notes to this repo, but I do when I can and when I learn a new concept I don't want to forget.

<br>

Initially, this was meant to be a private repository for studying, but I've decided to make it public in the hopes that it might help someone else as well. I'd also like to allow contributions via pull requests to continue to grow this knowledge base. I try to site my notes where needed, but if you see something that I've used that I did not properly credit, please let me know.

<br>

I am by no means an expert, these notes are a combination of MDN docs, Udemy courses, YouTube, a free [21 day drip course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) offered by Kevin Powell, Stackoverflow, my own personal notes and various other websites or web dev tips I've received, including real work experience. Recently(_as of 2023_), I've begun using AI to accelerate my learning process. AI such as ChatGPT(_openai_), Copilot(_Microsoft_) and Gemini(_Google_) have had a tremendously positive impact on my learning, although often you need to fact check the answers it will give you. I also use copilot in VScode which is fantastic. I wouldn't say it's necessary but I highly recommend giving it a chance. If there's ever a mistake or info that's incorrect or outdated, please let me know so I can correct it and update it ASAP, or open a PR.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read this, I appreciate you and your passion for development, stay awesome üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª
