# Vault-of-Knowledge
*A repo to hold all of the notes I've taken on my Web Dev journey*
<br>
<br>
## This repo will hold notes on HTML, CSS, JS, Figma, Git & GitHub, etc.
I've needed a place to hold my notes for quite some time now, and a friend of mine showed me all of the neat ways you can style a .md(README) file to make it stand out more.
So this will be a constantly growing database of knowledge and cheatsheets to refer to in times of need.
It will hold snapshots of code I've found useful, of code I've written and of handy examples.
This repo is private but may be released as public in the future as it grows, if I feel confident with the accuracy of my notes and would like to help out other new devs.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, stay awesome :).<br>
