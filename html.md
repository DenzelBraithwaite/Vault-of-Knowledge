## **HTML Elements Reference**

<br>

## Main root

<br>

### `<html>`

The _\<html>_ HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.

<br>

## Document metadata

Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information.

<br>

### `<head>`

The _\<head>_ HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style sheets.

<br>

### `<link>`

The _\<link>_ HTML element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.

<br>

### `<meta>`

The _\<meta>_ HTML element represents Metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like base, link, script, style or title.

<br>

### `<style>`

The _\<style\>_ HTML element contains style information for a document, or part of a document. It contains CSS, which is applied to the contents of the document containing the \<style\> element. 

<br>

### `<title>`

The _\<title>_ HTML element defines the document's title that is shown in a Browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.

<br>

## Sectioning root

### `<body>`

The _\<body>_ HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one \<body> element in a document.

<br>

## Content sectioning

Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.

<br>

### `<address>`

The _\<address>_ HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.

<br>

### `<article>`

The _\<article>_ HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.

<br>

### `<aside>`

The _\<aside>_ HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.

<br>

### `<footer>`

The _\<footer>_ HTML element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A _\<footer>_ typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

<br>

### `<header>`

The _\<header>_ HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

<br>

### `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>,`

The _\<h1>_ to _\<h6>_ HTML element represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.

<br>

### `<main>`

The _\<main>_ HTML element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.

<br>

### `<nav>`

The _\<nav>_ HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.

<br>

### `<section>`

The _\<section>_ HTML element represents a generic standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few exceptions.
